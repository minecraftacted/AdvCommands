# Command Execution
This plugin provides features that don't exist in Minecraft commands themselves or are inconvenient to use with commands, but it generally doesn't provide functionality that can already be done with basic Minecraft commands.

Command execution allows you to call basic Minecraft commands from within scripts.

## Usage
- Execute a command
```
cmd command
```

## Usage Examples
```
# Ban oun9
cmd ban oun9
```
