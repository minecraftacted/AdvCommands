# Basic Operations & Powers
You can easily implement basic arithmetic operations and exponentiation that were previously done using `scoreboard` and other methods.

## Usage
The first and second values are abstracted as x and y for explanation purposes.

- Addition
```
<x+y>
```
- Subtraction
```
<x-y>
```
- Multiplication
```
<x*y>
```
- Division
```
<x/y>
```
- Exponentiation
```
<x^y>
```

## Usage Examples
```
# Addition
<1+1>
# Subtraction
<2-1>
# Multiplication
<5*4>
# Division
<9/3>
# Division (remainder/modulo)
<8%5>
# Exponentiation
<2^10>
# Operations with 3 or more values (3)
<1+<1+1>>
```
