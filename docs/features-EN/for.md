# Loops
Repeat a specific number of times.

In Minecraft commands, this can be implemented using `scoreboard` and `execute`, but this plugin simplifies it much more.

## Usage
- Repeat a statement a specific number of times
```
for count statement
```
- Get the current iteration count within a user function
```
<i>
```

## Usage Examples
```
# Execute function hoge 10 times
for 10 hoge
```
